Introduction
=============

GenSol is a open source package for linear simulation of photonic circuit, based on the well known scattering matrix method.
It features include:
    - A collection of pre-defined building blocks for easy definition of circuits;
    - Easy calculation of S-parameters of a photonic circuit;
    - Parametric building blocks;
    - Hierarchical circuit definition;
    - Monitors inside the circuit for calculation of power flow.

Installation
-------------
The package depends on the following python package:
 * **Python** (tested 3.6.9)
 * **NumPy** (tested on 1.18.2)
 * **SciPy** (tested on 1.4.1)
 * **Pandas** (tested on 1.0.3)

After cloning the repository, just make sure the foleder solver is in the PYTHONPATH.
