# GenSol package

GenSol is a open source package for linear simulation of photonic circuit, based on the well known scattering matrix method.
It features include:
- A collection of pre-defined building blocks for easy definition of circuits;
- Easy calculation of S-parameters of a photonic circuit;
- Parametric building blocks;
- Hierarchical circuit definition;
- Monitors inside the circuit for calculation of power flow.

## Installation
After cloning, just add teh repository folder to the PYTHONPATH. 
The package depends on the following python packages:
- NumPy (tested on 1.18.2)
- SciPy (tested on 1.4.1)
- Pandas (tested on 1.0.3)
